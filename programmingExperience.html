            I programmed in java, html, css, javascript, python and assembly.
            I programmed the most in java. I had a full course on it.
            I also programmed in python, but that was a long time ago. 
            I had some experience with html, css and javascript 
            but not a lot.
            And finally, I have some experience in assembly. 
            I had to programm in assembly for a course called 
            computer organisation at TUDelft.
