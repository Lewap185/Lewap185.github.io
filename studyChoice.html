      <p class="bolderText">Why did you chose ICT?</p>
      <p>
        I got my first introduction to programming in my first year on TUDelft
        studying mechanical engineering I chose to switch to Computer Science
        and Engineering also on TUDelft I programmed enough in those 2 years
        that I am certain I want to continue it as a career.
      </p>
      <p class="bolderText">
        Why are you certain you want to continue it as a career?
      </p>
      <p>
        ICT has good career opportunities. I am also excellent at abstract and
        algorithmic thinking and I also love to solve problemens related to math
        and computer science.
      </p>
      <p class="bolderText">
        Why do you love to think algorithmicly and abstractly?
      </p>
      <p>
        Because there is no room for ambiguity. Everything is either true or
        false with no in between. I personally do not like it if there is no
        structure or ambiguity. It gives me anxiety and no peace
      </p>
      <p class="bolderText">
        Why is having good career opportunities important to you?
      </p>
      <p>
        Having a good income is important to me because it allows me to take
        better care of the people around me. It gives me a sense of importance
        and fullfilment.
      </p>
      <p class="bolderText">
        Why does it give you a sense of importance and fullfilment?
      </p>
      <p>
        I will be able to accomplish my God-given goal better on this earth for
        His sake and for my family. I have a responsibility to make the most of
        my life and talents and I think the ICT program will allow me to
        accomplish that goal in the most efficient way possible.
